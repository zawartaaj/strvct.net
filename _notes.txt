Sites:
- Start converting Io and Dekorte sites to JSON?


Browser:
- need back arrow - add new Browser class with header, footer, stack view in middle - room for shelf?
- need special highlight for end node
- make return act like click if whole column is selected (so we can add node with keyboard?)
-- how to add node from keyboard in non empty column?

Resources:
- have it look for some file like _autoImport?
- move BMResourceFile loading code to to parent BMResource?
- Abstraction for ResourceEntry?


Notifications:
- clean up Notification posts/obs with new Node methods? (BMNotification instance).newObservation()


	this.postNoteNamed("hello")
        this.watchOnceForNote("hello")
        this.watchOnceForNoteFrom("hello", sourceObject)
        this.observeNote(aFileLoader.doneNote()) // still need to handle observation removal
        this.observeNoteOnce(aFileLoader.doneNote()) 


Misc:
- use fixed width font on pre text nodes
- make return end editing on node label edits
- can drop nodes into root folder but can't move them out
- cancelling delete on row doesn't reset it's background color
