- full width title view

----------------------------------------------

- feature: expand first visible column to fit width of display when too small to fit next 2 columns?
- bug: not clearing next column when removing item that selected it

----------------------------------------------

- cleanup: mutatorMethodNamesSet
-- move into categories? move all mutatorMethodNamesSet declarations into single file?

----------------------------------------------

- rename "Row" to "Item"?
- rename BrowserRow.column to "itemSet?"


BMFolderView?
- can't edit folder names - possible double tap issue?

cleanup:
- BrowserRow
-- move isTapLongPress to a new GestureRecognizer or into DomView?
-- move key modifiers in onTapComplete to GestureRecognizer?
--- rename justTap/justShiftTap/etc to onTap/onShiftTap? Or should diff prefix be used for internally sent events? onLocalTap?
- change column() to stackItemSet() or itemSet()?

general:
- is prepareToRetire being called when appropriate?
--- does the DOM handle handler removal automatically? Probably not as this objects have lots of external refs


----------------------------------------------

Inline Row views? for Document style rendering

- add BMNode.inlineLevelHint
- have BMNodeView.visibleNodes looks at inlineLevelHint
- add BMNode.subitemsFlattenedToLevel(n)


- want to be able to go from, say, json doc structure to inlined doc e.g. Io guide
- what do we need for that?
- InlinedContainerRowView
- Document (inline container), Section (inline container), Header, Text, Media, References, Links

issues:
- need to be able to option-click inspect
- need within-row selection protocol
- should 

-------------------------------
| InlinedContainerRowView
|  subviews
|
|

- we want to be able to use existing drag and drop between parts of the hierarcy
- what if document not presented subnode hierarchy as flat list of rows <<<<
- these rows have drag UI that supports inserting at a level, perhaps by how far inset they are?
-- two types of rows: grouping rows and and content rows? which have different drop interpretation behaviors
---- content rows always inserted under level of first preceeding grouping row
---- grouping row needs some sort of guideline highlight with snap for drop level?
---- or force UI into non-inline mode for editing and all problems solved except naturalness? 
- maybe after insert, top node figures out and assigns indent level?
- UI to move indent level?

- would also like to keep way of browsing document with normal node structure on small displays
- would need to deal with stack view expectations around node parent chain 


PathView:
- example on wide display:

	< Io / docs / guide

or in single column display:

	< guide 

at top level:

	Io

also (if view wide and tall enough):

	Io
	/ docs / guide



Sites:
- Start converting Io and Dekorte sites to JSON?


Browser:
- need back arrow - add new Browser class with header, footer, stack view in middle - room for shelf?
-- should this be implemented as separate header footer view?
--- pros: (for no BrowserView)
---- reuse options menus, resizing, reorg of StackView, allow sub paths views??
--- cons:
----- still need footer view for some UIs?


- need special highlight for end node
- make return act like click if whole column is selected (so we can add node with keyboard?)
-- how to add node from keyboard in non empty column?

Resources:
- have it look for some file like _autoImport?
- move BMResourceFile loading code to to parent BMResource?
- Abstraction for ResourceEntry?


Notifications:
- clean up Notification posts/obs with new Node methods? (BMNotification instance).newObservation()


	this.postNoteNamed("hello")
        this.watchOnceForNote("hello")
        this.watchOnceForNoteFrom("hello", sourceObject)
        this.observeNote(aFileLoader.doneNote()) // still need to handle observation removal
        this.observeNoteOnce(aFileLoader.doneNote()) 


Misc:
- use fixed width font on pre text nodes
- make return end editing on node label edits
- can drop nodes into root folder but can't move them out
- cancelling delete on row doesn't reset it's background color
