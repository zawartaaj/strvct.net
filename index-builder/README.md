# IndexBuilder

   This script builds a index.html file for the app
   containing all the css and js file content.
  
   The resulting index.html (with the font and icon folders) 
   should be able to run the app on it's own.
   
   Run within the indexbuilder folder:
   
   	node IndexBuilder.js
	
  The resulting index.html file will be placed in the home folder.
