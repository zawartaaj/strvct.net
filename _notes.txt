Sites:
- Start converting Io and Dekortre sites to JSON?


Browser:
- resize window behavior different from layout resulting from row selection
- key nav not moving selected node into view
- need special highlight for end node
- need back arrow
- weird column collapse/uncollapse behavior
- make return act like click if whole column is selected (so we can add node with keyboard?)
-- how to add node from keyboard in non empty column?

Resources:
- have it look for some file like _autoImport?
- move BMResourceFile loading code to to parent BMResource?
- Abstraction for ResourceEntry?


Notifications:
- clean up Notification posts/obs with new Node methods? (newObservation, etc)


Misc:
- use fixed width font on pre text nodes
- make return end editing on node label edits
